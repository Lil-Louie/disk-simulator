DiskSim â€” Disk Scheduling Simulator in C++

A modular, event-driven disk scheduling simulator implementing and comparing five classic disk I/O scheduling algorithms:

FCFS â€” First-Come, First-Served
ST â€” Same Track Clustering
Pick-Up â€” Greedy track-based optimization
LOOK â€” Optimized SCAN (skips empty tracks)
C-LOOK â€” Circular LOOK, fairer version of LOOK
Features

Event-driven simulation using custom TimerEvent and DiskDoneEvent classes
Real-time queue tracking and performance statistics:
Min/Max/Average queue lengths
Total requests completed
Clean OOP design using C++17
Easy to extend and test with custom input files
Build Instructions

Requirements
C++17 compatible compiler (g++, clang++)
Make (or compile manually)
Build and Run
# Compile using Makefile
make alldisks.x

# Run simulation with input file
./alldisks.x inputRequests.txt
Sample Output

========== FINAL DISK STATS ==========

[FCFS] Stats:
  Total Requests Completed: 10
  Min Queue Length: 0
  Max Queue Length: 3
  Avg Queue Length: 2.20

[ST] Stats:
  Total Requests Completed: 10
  Min Queue Length: 0
  Max Queue Length: 3
  Avg Queue Length: 1.20
